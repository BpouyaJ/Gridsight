## Current phase

Phase 1 - Foundation

Current step: 1.3 - PostgreSQL runtime and Python connection smoke test

Status: completed

## Completed

- Compared Codex, ChatGPT Work, reasoning settings, agents, skills, and plugins.
- Approved Codex as the primary development environment.
- Researched official and credible energy-data options.
- Selected Bundesnetzagentur SMARD as the essential source.
- Selected Germany/DE-LU, hourly grain, and 2022-2025 coverage.
- Selected Germany-wide load as the only essential forecasting target.
- Approved the architecture, analytical model, Power BI scope, Excel scope, and development phases.
- Created the Git repository and approved folder structure.
- Persisted the roadmap, decision log, source contract, data policy, and agent workflow.
- Verified local Markdown links, ignored-data rules, and the absence of implementation code.
- Created a Python 3.13 virtual environment under `.venv`.
- Added `pyproject.toml` with runtime, analysis, and development dependency groups.
- Installed GridSight as an editable package with its approved analytics and database dependencies.
- Added Windows development-environment instructions.
- Passed the initial package smoke test with pytest.
- Passed the Ruff code-quality check.
- Added a healthy PostgreSQL 17.10 service using Docker Compose.
- Added an ignored local `.env` credential workflow and persistent database volume.
- Added validated database settings and a SQLAlchemy/Psycopg connection factory.
- Passed the Python-to-PostgreSQL connection command.
- Passed the marked PostgreSQL integration test while keeping it out of the default fast test suite.

## In progress

None. Step 1.3 and Phase 1 are ready for their Git checkpoint.

## Not started

- SMARD downloads
- Pipeline implementation
- Forecasting
- Power BI
- Excel/Power Query

## Next bounded step

After Step 1.3 is committed and pushed, start Step 2.1: create the source-manifest schema and reproducible SMARD raw-data intake workflow before downloading the first snapshot.

## Current blockers

None.
